There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it. He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels.  "Let us go back!" he shouted, and began turning the pony round. "We cannot cross this--hell," he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent, crouching in their seat and shivering. Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon "George."  My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute. "We must go that way," he said, and led the pony round again. For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To force their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its head.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her. "Point the revolver at the man behind," he said, giving it to her, "if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse." Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through Chipping Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress. They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible. Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them. They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and none of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my brother had come. Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly through the home counties.  Not only
